##OttaDD

ottadd.herokuapp.com
The project allows users to visually design a database and implement it on their rails app. They could also generate a custom tutorial that will guide the user step by step to set up the whole database on rails. 


## Motivation

Creation of a basic crud system is often a simple and repetitive process. The initial intention of the project was to be able to translate visual representation of a database into a function database system on Rails

## Use

Go to ottaDD and generate a database there, you can either generate a ruby file that you may run to generate your database or construct a custom tutorial.

## Future Plans

To be able to dynamically alter a running rails database through the ottaDD app.
